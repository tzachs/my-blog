Hi there,

This is my first post using Github as a place to host my blog.
Till now I've been hosting it using Blogger, but, Blogger is missing a main feature I need which is code blocks.

So, after getting a lot of recommendations from a friend about Hugo (See at https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/)
I've switched.
