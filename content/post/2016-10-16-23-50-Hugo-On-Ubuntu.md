It took me sometime to understand how to use hugo and the site that helped me the most, besides my good friend Erik Zaadi (Check out his amazing blog at http://erikzaadi.com/), was this site: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-hugo-a-static-site-generator-on-ubuntu-14-04

I totally recommend it in case you are thinking of using Hugo
